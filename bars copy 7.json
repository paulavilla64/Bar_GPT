If you're lucky, you might get Juno playing some music on the open mic, which will make for a great night.",

                    "The place is nice and cozy, but the bar staff was extremely unfriendly, and also rude. No one in the group wanted to go and order the next rounds because the bartender (the bald gentleman with glasses) was almost scary to interact with, so \u2026",

I\u2019ve been waiting for new coals since the last 40 mins, asked already three times nicely, but the waiter snapped at me and told me that he doesn\u2019t have time.

On the first floor there's sort of a nightclub, with live music & DJs occasionally. It's a shame that as it's allowed to smoke at the nightclub, it's covered with a stinky cloud of smoke",
                    "Went here on May the fourth, had expected more of a Star Wars feel inside but there was not one. However the wild garlic soup was delicious, and I was pleased with the overall atmosphere of this bar/pub.",

                    "Really nice bar, was really buzzy on. Saturday afternoon. They have really nice refreshing drinks and cocktails with a twist, reminded me of a cool East London hangout without being overpriced and a bit more mainstream. Nice deco and lots of outside space. Also dog friendly which is a bonus.",

                    "The pub is nice and beautiful, but the dj was changing music constantly, people also just sit fown instead of dancing. Wierd place, i might still visit it because of the ambience, hope people will be dancing next time i go there",
                    "Cool place in the city centre. Amazing drinks, friendly staff, diverse and stylish crowd. Perfect place to hang out on a warm summer evening."

                    "Monroe\u2019s is a great place to hang out with friends and drink a few beverages.  With Stuttgart being a bit of a desert when it\u2019s comes to gay or gay friendly bars, this ia a great place to be.  The location is also very nice on the second level of the pedestrian area.  Lots of people watching.",
                    "Worst gay bar experience ever. I ordered two glasses of beer. Gave the waiter 20 euros and didn't give me change.",
                    "Not friendly people, a staff member had a Bully behaviohur. he lead us at the door just because he tought we were straight\u2026 in 2023? better spend our money somewhere else",
                    "I visited this place for the first time. The bar has karaoke and its gay friendly. The vibe is very nice. The place is small and very aesthetic with a Marilyn Monroe vibe. It has a good variety of drinks. There is also a vending machine for \u2026",
                    "Only cash, my purchase not keyed in cash machine. Nice leger music but hard to talk, just outside. No one out alone, just safe groups.",
                    "Bartenders are friendly, the atmosphere and the music are great. It's only a bit crowded, there's too many people inside such a small place. And there's almost always some kind of an incident, for example someone smashing bottles or \u2026",
                    "The worst place you can ever have go to!!! My coat was stolen, and I had to go home almost wearing nothing when it was so freaking outside. Neither security nor staff did anything to help!!!\nAvoid this bar!!!",
                    "We are tourists traveling to various places in Europe, we found this place by google location but it was not a good idea, when we went into the bar we did not know that it had an entry control and the host took my sister very strongly by \u2026",
                    "First time there in February 2022 was really special, queer people basically were everywhere and u feel involved and the vibe was the best with many famous lgbt songs and we sang along. \u2026"
