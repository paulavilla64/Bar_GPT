                    "The cocktails were very nice, and we spent 2.5 hours here with zero problem. However, when we went to ask the bartender what drink he was making while sitting at the bar, he literally freaked out and gave us a lecture about bothering him. \u2026",
                    "One of the best Cocktail places in Stuttgart.\nDecent but not snobbish atmosphere.\nFair pricing for superb drinks. Crowd is a mixture of students, boheme and established people. Ring the bell!",
                    "One of the.. sorry the best bar experience in the city. A hidden gem, authentic as it can be in the most authentic neighborhood.\nGreat spot for an intimate date, a classy boys night out or simply a place to go \u2026",
                    "Absolutely incredible! The best signature smoky old fashion I have ever drunk.\nElegant, with style, prices \u20ac\u20ac lovely atmosphere with Spanish guitar music.\nAttention and good service.\nWhat they do is magical.",
                    "Used to be a speak easy now you just need to knock. Classy cocktails in what feels to be a hidden part of Stuttgart",
                    "Great hidden gem in this city in the style of a speakeasy. Place is cozy, and the staff is extremely friendly. Max behind the bar was helpful and the guys make great cocktails. If you're lucky, you might get Juno playing some music on the open mic, which will make for a great night.",
                    "A very good cocktail bar in the heart of the now-hipster red light district as many other cocktail joints.",
                    "The place is nice and cozy, but the bar staff was extremely unfriendly, and also rude. No one in the group wanted to go and order the next rounds because the bartender (the bald gentleman with glasses) was almost scary to interact with, so \u2026",
                    "The drinks were truly amazing, staff is really competent and friendly, the environment is very relaxed and welcoming .. i just loved this place..",
                    "Nice place. Deffinately a hole in the wall.  They did not serve us because they had no seating.  We had 8 in our party, they had 6 customers and could only seat 3 of us.  You can do the math."

On the first floor there's sort of a nightclub, with live music & DJs occasionally. It's a shame that as it's allowed to smoke at the nightclub, it's covered with a stinky cloud of smoke",

This will be another casualty of the high street within 1 year.  Avoid and visit L\u2019Oasis instead. Do not waste your time with this place.",

Turning away over \u20ac300, that really makes business sense!!! Instead we found L\u2019Oasis who are more then accommodating!",

After we sat down and ordered and the order came the waiter came and told us we have to change to a table very far away from where we were sitting just because their rules says no two men should not sit alone. This was in the afternoon and we were sitting outside. I never heard of such a rule in my life.",
