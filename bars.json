Food is focused on vegetarians - do not expect the satisfaction of a steak House visit here ;-) Food is healthy and prepared well (in stark contrast to other local kitchen..) Need to return to check out the music events!",

                    "Nicely decorated bar on the ground floor, good for grabbing a drink and eat something. The music is generally good. On the first floor there's sort of a nightclub, with live music & DJs occasionally. It's a shame that as it's allowed to smoke at the nightclub, it's covered with a stinky cloud of smoke",
