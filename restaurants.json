We will definitely return!",

                    "Outstanding dinner! Reservations are required. The service was fantastic. We don't speak or read German but our lovely waitress explained a good portion of the menu so we knew what to order. The menu changes but I understand that the schnitzel is a must-have. My father-in-law had it and loved it.",

                    "The salad for the schnitzel was great. Never had anything like it. The schnitzel was the best in town. The Thai soup was also good especially at $7euro. My steak with noodles had great taste. The steak had some chewy fat that I could have \u2026",

Make sure to make a reservation, we were lucky to get a spot reserved only at 21:00. Great food, great wine and atmosphere under the nearby trees in this quiet street.",
                    "We went there as a group of four with two. My wife and I had never been before, but our friends had been several times. The bar was set high and Vetter lived up to the hype. The best Schw\u00e4bisch meal that I have had yet. Service was curt but \u2026",
                    "Best Schnitzel in Stuttgart. Wine selection is good. Salad is fresh with a nice selection of appetizers. Bring your glasses because the menu is hand written and difficult to read. Parking is minimal on the streets. But the food is \u2026",
                    "The spare ribs are very delicious, the best I've every had in my life. The bread is very tasty. We had chocolate melt cake for desert, yummmm, everything is top notch, our server is attentive, will definitely come back next time I visit Berlin!"
