        incorporate into your system.

            - Used to scrap data from google maps using Selenium and Chromium Driver

        ## Bars.json
            - This file contains the output from the mining of data

    Design the Dialogue Flow: [31.5.]
        Define the structure and flow of the conversation.
        Determine the possible user intents and corresponding system responses.
        Identify key dialogue scenarios, such as making a reservation, requesting information, 
        or suggesting a bar based on preferences.

    Natural Language Understanding (NLU): [7.6.]
        Implement an NLU module to understand user inputs.
        Intent classification
        Slot filling

    Natural Language Generation (NLG): [14.6.]
        Implement an NLG component to generate human-like responses.
        Template based approach or machine learning???

    Dialogue Management (Belief state and Policy): [21.6.]
        Design a dialogue management system to handle the flow of the conversation.
        Implement a belief state tracker to keep track of the dialogue context.

        state.

    Testing: [28.6]
        Test the system thoroughly to ensure it handles various user inputs and scenarios effectively.
        Detect errors and remove bugs
        Add synonyms for every single bar

  Databank 
  Ontology
  Dialogue Flow
  Github
  NLU (testing with pass through from exercises)


  07.06 meet Lindsey:
  Questions:
  What should we do about the synonyms?
  Json to SQLlite data base
  Test NLU
  NLG (also start with policy)

  14.06 meeting:
  Questions: 
  Adapt json for InformRules and RequestRules?
  binary slots?
  Test NLU?
  Policy?

  21.06 meeting:
  Beliefstate erweitern für make a reservation
  Test NLU
  Test NLG
  start with policy

 - online regex checker (request) https://regex101.com/
 - solely inform has value, not request
 --> e.g. "I'm looking for a bar with live music" is a requestable and informable...but should just be informable
 - policy add booking function (beliefstate)
 - beliefstate utils
 - booking function
    which day?   -> check if the bar is open
    which timee?    -> check if bar is open
    would you like a reservation?
        -> reservation
        -> booking information
- tutorial ilias
- new sys act add to: nlu, policy, nlg, beliefstate, bst.py (beliefstate tracker)
- new entity in belifstate (bst.py -> beliefstate tracker)


28.06.23 (last) meeting:
testing nlu, NLG
both should be debugged
start policy (add new sys act)

questions:
ß ? Does it have something to do with the encoding? language is just english?

- run_bars.py copy from run_chat.py
- create launch
- add breakpoints for debugging 
- add system/ user-act
- request reservation (can you make me a reservation)
- inform reservation (what day? what time?)
- policy needs to decide when to start reservation

- conditions to start "booking"

- test the policy with running the whole system
- default: starting with the user utterance

Extracting opening times: for some bars there are no opening times shown (even though they have them in Google Maps)
Update NLU with possible questions for make a reservation
implement logic if the user writes something the bot doesnt understand
implement closing times (hours)
Unfortunately, Holzmaler is closed at monday 2pm. For which other day and time would you like to make a reservation?
--> here booking mode still has to be turned on
delete bar
Opening times for e.g. cafes in the morning
If the user asks first for a time where the bar is closed the hours[1] doesnt exist
