On the first floor there's sort of a nightclub, with live music & DJs occasionally. It's a shame that as it's allowed to smoke at the nightclub, it's covered with a stinky cloud of smoke",
                    "Went here on May the fourth, had expected more of a Star Wars feel inside but there was not one. However the wild garlic soup was delicious, and I was pleased with the overall atmosphere of this bar/pub.",

I think the prices are too high though (8€ for a glass of white wine?!), The crowd is trendy, too much sometimes ;)",

They have really nice refreshing drinks and cocktails with a twist, reminded me of a cool East London hangout without being overpriced and a bit more mainstream. Nice deco and lots of outside space. Also dog friendly which is a bonus.",
