Also dog friendly which is a bonus.",

With Stuttgart being a bit of a desert when it\u2019s comes to gay or gay friendly bars, this ia a great place to be.  The location is also very nice on the second level of the pedestrian area.  Lots of people watching.",

On the first floor there's sort of a nightclub, with live music & DJs occasionally. It's a shame that as it's allowed to smoke at the nightclub, it's covered with a stinky cloud of smoke",

Also dog friendly which is a bonus.",

                    "Has been around forever and is still a fun boozer with relatively cheap drinks, tasty pub grub and good music, mostly rock. If you feel thirsty, order a metre of beer, if you feel suicidal, go for the litre of schnapps",
                    "Really amazing place. Mainly went to watch Der Klassiker but the pub itself is really good and cheap.",
                    "Cool vintage german bar. We had a lot of fun. Also the peanut fight was very funny.\nStaff was nice, only they were very angry we got a birthday cake and did not \u2026",
                    "Authentic German bar with a variety of drinks. The snacks are also pretty well. But the main area is smoking area which really kills the mood.",
                    "It is a place that can be crowded. It is a regular pub. The staff organizes games or quizzes. That brings some refreshment. Beer and food are acceptable. Once a waiter was extremely rude and offend us because we complained that he brought drinks different to the ones we ordered. It seems that guy doesn't work there anymore.",
                    "The prices aren't anything to write home about but the atmosphere is great. Getting a seat inside is the preferred experience here unless you just want to come for the food as the outside is often a bit more relaxed.",
                    "Great local bar with friendly staff and amazing atmosphere. Can only recommend",
                    "Here everything is different. It is kind of big place but you will have to dive through the narrow aisles but the atmosphere is so cool, If you like to be impacted by a peanut. Every Thursday night the bartender is giving to you some \u2026"

On the first floor there's sort of a nightclub, with live music & DJs occasionally. It's a shame that as it's allowed to smoke at the nightclub, it's covered with a stinky cloud of smoke",

                    "Monroe\u2019s is a great place to hang out with friends and drink a few beverages.  With Stuttgart being a bit of a desert when it\u2019s comes to gay or gay friendly bars, this ia a great place to be.  The location is also very nice on the second level of the pedestrian area.  Lots of people watching.",

                    "I visited this place for the first time. The bar has karaoke and its gay friendly. The vibe is very nice. The place is small and very aesthetic with a Marilyn Monroe vibe. It has a good variety of drinks. There is also a vending machine for \u2026",
                    "Only cash, my purchase not keyed in cash machine. Nice leger music but hard to talk, just outside. No one out alone, just safe groups.",

                    "The worst place you can ever have go to!!! My coat was stolen, and I had to go home almost wearing nothing when it was so freaking outside. Neither security nor staff did anything to help!!!\nAvoid this bar!!!",
                    "We are tourists traveling to various places in Europe, we found this place by google location but it was not a good idea, when we went into the bar we did not know that it had an entry control and the host took my sister very strongly by \u2026",

                    "Excellent cocktails and the staff is really friendly. The cocktails are phenomenal and the atmosphere of the bar is really cozy, with good jazz playing on the back and low light. Diogo makes really good improvised cocktails, and off the menu I personally recommend the Old Fashioned.",

And you can get customized drinks to your own taste anytime, I have to admit that I was amazed once or twice or three times ;)",

                    "It\u2019s a really cool place! Tiny space, but lovely people. Their cocktails are fantastic! You should ask the bartender for their specials. Only real downside is that people smoke inside, but I guess that\u2019s also something that makes this bar unique.",

                    "It\u2019s a great cozy bar located in the heart of the old\nCity of Stuttgart. In fact, it\u2019s placed right on the red light district which gives it a special vibe. The staff is extremely friendly and the owners surely had \u2026",
                    "It takes forever to get a cocktail, but the wait is worth it. Cool vibe with three different floors/areas to lounge, dance, hang out. Very popular place, but we luckily found a table with table service. Our server was very friendly and the bartender could shake her drinks!",
                    "Cocktails were just amazingly delicious, super friendly service, good atmosphere, care to every detail... I am definitely coming bach there.",
                    "I had drinks after dinner with friends, very good cocktails, the barman had a great energy, he was super nice and chatty and help us spend a nice night out! Probably my fav cocktail bar in stuttgart till now!",
                    "Delicious drinks, dope beats and good vibes. Best thing though was the bar staff, absolutely beautiful humans inside and out. 11/10 would recommend.",
                    "Probably The worst coctail bar that I ever been. I will never forget the attitude and impoliteness.",
                    "Nice coktail bar.  Cozy place for weekend or afterwork to have a coktail and enjoy.  Friday and Saturday they have DJ and it is much more crowded. It is friendly to internationals and to groups.  Not romantic but ok for a date...  you have to try it!",
                    "For me personally one of the best bars in Stuttgart. Great service with bartenders who take their time to serve you an individualized cocktail - and this always with a smile:-) Great!",
                    "YOU CAN'T GET IN BECAUSE YOU DONT HAVE A GIRL WITH YOU! Im really tired of this behaviour. This is what you get in a lot of places in Stuttgart. There was friend of mine visiting from US and started to pour outside. So we decided to stop \u2026"

I came here with my colleagues and it was literally difficult to get a table. Overall I would say it was a nice visit.",

                    "Nice bar, centrally located right across the Schlossplatz. In summer it's great to sit outside on the stairs and enjoy a drink while looking at the busy Koenigstrasse. I think the prices are too high though (8€ for a glass of white wine?!), The crowd is trendy, too much sometimes ;)",
                    "Really nice bar, was really buzzy on. Saturday afternoon. They have really nice refreshing drinks and cocktails with a twist, reminded me of a cool East London hangout without being overpriced and a bit more mainstream. Nice deco and lots of outside space. Also dog friendly which is a bonus.",

                    "The pub is nice and beautiful, but the dj was changing music constantly, people also just sit fown instead of dancing. Wierd place, i might still visit it because of the ambience, hope people will be dancing next time i go there",
                    "Cool place in the city centre. Amazing drinks, friendly staff, diverse and stylish crowd. Perfect place to hang out on a warm summer evening."

                    "Great place, in good weather they keep the door open so the cigarette smell is less strong.  They have nice wines and cocktails, some bottled beers, but the alcohol free options are underwhelming",
                    "Very very interesting place in Stuttgart. You can play table football drink beer... Everybody are chilling there... And what ist more important no stress please. Only the bad thing is that is a little bit dirty, or  I would like to say not \u2026",
                    "Smokers bar. The environment is cozy but hard to get a table. Also if you are a non smoker you will probably prefer as seat outside.\nPlenty of beers and cocktail selection",

                    "Smoker Bar. Often full or at least quite busy. Prices are ok for stuggart. Cocktails are good but a bit overpriced.\nSeatings are worn out...so be careful when u sit down ^^",

Attention to every detail has been looked at to create this vintage vibe- including the menu being made to look like an old French newspaper. The 1920s and 30s jazz music was also a nice touch.

On the first floor there's sort of a nightclub, with live music & DJs occasionally. It's a shame that as it's allowed to smoke at the nightclub, it's covered with a stinky cloud of smoke",

Be aware that you cannot put your belongings/ coats on the empty stools even if the bar is quiet empty\u2026 just in case someone walks in? If you do the service will defo make you feel unwelcome.",
