On the first floor there's sort of a nightclub, with live music & DJs occasionally. It's a shame that as it's allowed to smoke at the nightclub, it's covered with a stinky cloud of smoke",

The drinks are reasonably priced unlike most places in Germany which are way more expensive. And Josef the owner makes some fancy drinks to impress your date. I highly recommend this bar if you are in town.",

One of my favourite places in Stuttgart to have a drink after work or to get the night started !",
