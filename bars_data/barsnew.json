I will never forget the attitude and impoliteness.~Nice coktail bar.  Cozy place for weekend or afterwork to have a coktail and enjoy.  Friday and Saturday they have DJ and it is much more crowded. It is friendly to internationals and to groups.  Not romantic but ok for a date...  you have to try it!~For me personally one of the best bars in Stuttgart. Great service with bartenders who take their time to serve you an individualized cocktail - and this always with a smile:-) Great!~YOU CAN'T GET IN BECAUSE YOU DONT HAVE A GIRL WITH YOU!

Waiter seemed annoyed for whatever reason. Would not recommend~The most important point about this place is the vibe and the music. It is really cool and you can have a great time. In addition, the drinks are good ( not the best but still good) and you have wide range of choices.\nI can only recommend.~One of my favourite bars.  Friendly staff, great atmosphere. The place to go if you want a fun night out....~Awful experience. The \u201cmanager\u201d is a wanna be diva that has no clue of how to offer a good service and insult their clients.

Magic!~Nice place great roaring 20\u2019s atmosphere. Complements to the mixologist For the Amazing cocktails. Only gripe is that the smoke room needs better ventilation and air circulation it\u2019s harsh on the eyes in there. Other than that great place over all~Really enjoyed the atmosphere of the place. People told me that we were lucky as there was not many people and usually gets full and it is necessary to go early. \u2026~A really nice and secluded bar cocktail bar.

And yes it is my fault to go there repeatedly unlearning the manner of their treatment. Never again.~Place to be if you like smoking sisha and people watching~Horrible place, turned away business from 5 men because we didn\u2019t have one girl with us. Lost out on over \u20ac200, great way to do business?! This will be another casualty of the high street within 1 year.  Avoid and visit L\u2019Oasis instead. Do not waste your time with this place.~Monday night, went to ZOEs for Shisha with 5 guys, let me clarify it\u2019s a Monday night, we were turned away as we did not have any girls with us. Turning away over \u20ac300, that really makes business sense!!! Instead we found L\u2019Oasis who are more then accommodating!~This is a very strange place. After we sat down and ordered and the order came the waiter came and told us we have to change to a table very far away from where we were sitting just because their rules says no two men should not sit alone. This was in the afternoon and we were sitting outside. I never heard of such a rule in my life.~Very good service, nice stuff, good shisha\nperfect location near the old town~Is perfect for a evening when you want to have a mix between enjoying a good company but still wanna hear some music like in club. The place is clean and looks good and the service as well~Love their hookah. But not enough servers...usually have to sit and wait 15 minutes or have to chase down a server...especially if its summer and their outdoor seating is open...they need more people serving.~Shisha pipe looks promising but they are usinh strange tobacco so taste is below average in Stuttgart.
